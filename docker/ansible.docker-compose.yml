# For development is easiest to do changes on code locally
# and use a volume to run the changes on the containers directly
# otherwise the image has to be built everytime we do changes.
# For a pipeline, this docker-compose is not needed

# Must be executed from ROOT dir
# otherwise volumes dir must be updated
# docker-compose -f ./docker/ansible.docker-compose.yml up -d

# To enter the contaienr afte it runs
# docker exec -it ansible /bin/sh
